Treat this as the definitive requirement.\n\n2. **Determine Project Type**\n\n   * Use tool `Terminal.run` to execute `tree` and analyze the directory structure:\n\n     * **New Project**: If no existing directory or codebase is found.\n     * **Incremental Change**: If a codebase already exists.\n\n3. **New Project Design Deliverables**\n\n   **A. Implementation Approach**\n\n   * Clearly outline difficult or critical requirements.\n   * Choose suitable open-source frameworks or technologies.\n\n   **B. User & UI Interaction**\n\n   * Enumerate all primary user interactions with the UI.\n   * Ensure interactions are intuitive and user-friendly.\n\n   **C. System Architecture (PlantUML)**\n\n   * Clearly delineate Frontend, Backend, Databases, and Third-party system boundaries.\n   * File: `architect.plantuml`\n\n   **D. Data Structures & Interfaces (Class Diagram)**\n\n   * Use detailed PlantUML class diagram syntax.\n   * Include precise type annotations, methods (with explicit inputs and outputs), and relationships.\n   * Ensure compliance with PEP8.\n   * File: `class_diagram.plantuml`\n\n   **E. Program Call Flow (Sequence Diagram)**\n\n   * Use precise PlantUML sequence diagram syntax.\n   * Explicitly cover CRUD operations and initialization for each critical object.\n   * Clearly define exact input/output parameters and interactions between components.\n   * File: `sequence_diagram.plantuml`\n\n   **F. Database ER Diagram** *(if applicable)*\n\n   * Clearly define entities, relationships, keys, and constraints using correct PlantUML ER syntax.\n   * File: `er_diagram.plantuml`\n   \n   **G. UI Navigation Paths**  \n     - Modeled using PlantUML's **finite-state machine** notation.  \n     - Keep navigation depth to **no more than 3\u20134 levels**.  \n     - Surface **high-frequency functions and critical information** first.  \n     - Provide a **clear, obvious way back** at every step.\n\n   **H. Clarifications**\n\n   * Explicitly state any ambiguous requirements or technical uncertainties.\n   * Propose assumptions or request clarification.\n\n4. **Incremental Change Deliverable**\n\n   * Analyze current directory structure and existing implementation.\n   * Propose precise and feasible incremental changes or improvements.\n\n5. **Final Documentation** *(New Projects Only)*\n\n   * Write a comprehensive and clearly formatted system design markdown document:\n\n     * File: `system_design.md`\n     * Structure:\n\n       1. Implementation approach\n       2. User & UI interaction behaviors\n       3. Data structures and interfaces overview\n       4. Program call flow overview\n       5. Database ER diagram overview *(if applicable)*\n       6. Unclear aspects or assumptions\n\n6. **File Structure Overview** *(New Projects Only)*\n\n   * Generate a logical project folder and file structure based on the architectural and class diagrams.\n   * File: `file_tree.md`\n\n### Technology Defaults\n\n* **Frontend:** Shadcn-ui, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Playwright MCP(UI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528) (unless otherwise specified)\n* **Backend:** Specify clearly based on requirements or use sensible defaults as contextually appropriate.\n  * FastAPI with SQLModel is always the best choice to new projects.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* Always adhere strictly to MVP principles.\n* Provide detailed yet concise PlantUML diagrams.\n* Maintain a clean separation of concerns within the system architecture.\n* Ensure all syntax and conventions (PEP8, PlantUML) are strictly followed.\n* Ensure clarity, correctness, and comprehensiveness in all deliverables.\n\n### Reference System Design Example\n\n{system_design_example}\n\n### Project Template Information\n\n{template_info}\n\n### Other Notes\n1. **The `find` and `tree` commands must exclude dependency folders**, otherwise an LLM max-token error will occur:\n   - `find` example:  \n   `find <dirname> -type d \\( -name \"site-packages\" -o -name \"node_modules\" \\) -prune -o -print`\n   - `tree` example:  \n   `tree <dirname> -I 'site-packages|node_modules'`\n2.

install\n\n# Create environment file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Update .env with your backend API URL\n# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000\n\n# Start development server\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`\n\n### Build for Production\n\n```bash\npnpm run build\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 Design System\n\n**Theme**: Neon Intelligence (Futuristic AI OS)\n\n- **Colors**: Deep void backgrounds with neon blue, violet, cyan, and pink accents\n- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code\n- **Components**: Glass morphism cards, gradient buttons, animated AI orb\n- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, pulsing effects, hover states\n\n## \ud83d\udd0c Backend Integration\n\nThis frontend connects to the FastAPI backend. Make sure the backend is running and accessible at the URL specified in `.env`.\n\n### API Endpoints Used\n\n- `POST /auth/register` - User registration\n- `POST /auth/login` - User login\n- `GET /messages` - Fetch messages\n- `POST /messages/manual` - Create manual message\n- `GET /contacts` - Fetch contacts\n- `POST /contacts` - Create contact\n- `GET /events` - Fetch events\n- `POST /events` - Create event\n- `GET /integrations` - Fetch integrations\n\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 components/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 layout/          # Sidebar, TopBar, AppLayout\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 dashboard/       # AIOrb, StatsCard\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ui/              # shadcn/ui components\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pages/               # Route pages\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api/            # API client and services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks/          # Custom React hooks\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/          # Utility functions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 types/              # TypeScript type definitions\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd10 Authentication\n\nThe app uses JWT token authentication:\n\n1. User logs in via `/login`\n2. Access token stored in localStorage\n3. Token automatically added to API requests\n4. Auto-redirect to login on 401 errors\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Technology Stack\n\n- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript\n- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query\n- **Routing**: React Router v6\n- **HTTP Client**: Axios\n- **Build Tool**: Vite\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Development Notes\n\n### Adding New Pages\n\n1. Create page component in `src/pages/`\n2. Add route in `src/App.tsx`\n3. Add navigation item in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`\n\n### API Integration\n\n1. Define types in `src/types/`\n2. Create API service in `src/lib/api/`\n3. Use React Query hooks in components\n\n### Styling\n\n- Use Tailwind utility classes\n- Custom utilities: `.glass-panel`, `.gradient-primary`, `.neon-glow-*`\n- Follow the design system in `todo.md`\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Troubleshooting\n\n### Backend Connection Issues\n\n- Verify backend is running at the URL in `.env`\n- Check CORS settings in backend\n- Ensure API endpoints match backend routes\n\n### Build Errors\n\n```bash\n# Clear cache and reinstall\nrm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml\npnpm install\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 License\n\nProprietary - FANZ Unlimited Network\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b Support\n\nFor issues or questions, contact dev@fanz.network\n</content>\n</Editor.write>\n\nNow I'll run the linting and build process to ensure everything is working correctly.\n\n<Terminal.run>\n<cmd>\ncd /workspace/shadcn-ui && pnpm run lint\n</cmd>\n</Terminal.run>",

The absence of this feature suggests a failure to implement a key part of the design.\n\n2. **Dashboard with Stats Cards**: There are no visible stats cards for messages, contacts, or events in the screenshot. This indicates that the dashboard is incomplete and does not provide the necessary information at a glance.\n\n3. **Messages Inbox**: The screenshot does not show a messages inbox with multi-channel support and AI extraction highlights. This feature is essential for the CRM's functionality, and its absence detracts from the overall usability of the page.\n\n4. **Contacts Management**: There is no indication of a contacts management feature with tags and importance scores, which is crucial for organizing client information.\n\n5. **Calendar View**: The screenshot does not include a calendar view with events and sync status, which is vital for scheduling and managing appointments.\n\n6. **Workflows and Automation Page**: There is no reference to a workflows and automation page in the screenshot. This page would be important for users to set up automated responses and scheduling.\n\n7. **Integrations Hub**: The screenshot does not show an integrations hub for Twilio, Google Calendar, or Outlook, which are necessary for connecting with external services.\n\n8. **Settings Page**: There is no visible settings page with profile, API keys, and notifications. This is another critical component that is missing.\n\n9. **Futuristic Neon Design**: The design of the login screen does have a dark theme and some neon accents, which somewhat aligns with the futuristic design requirement. However, the overall look is very basic and lacks the glass morphism effects and gradient accents that were specified.\n\nGiven the analysis, the webpage fails to meet the functional requirements outlined in the instructions. The most glaring omissions are the lack of the main dashboard features, such as the AI Orb, stats cards, messages inbox, contacts management, calendar view, and automation features. \n\nThus, I would assign a grade of **0 (Fail)** since the content is unmodified and does not reflect the required design and functionality.\n\n<Render Grade>0</Render Grade>, Use tool `RoleZero.ask_human` to ask the user if fix is needed: 1) It's working fine. 2) Ask @Alex to fix the issue.",

The absence of this feature suggests a failure to implement a key part of the design.\n\n2. **Dashboard with Stats Cards**: There are no visible stats cards for messages, contacts, or events in the screenshot. This indicates that the dashboard is incomplete and does not provide the necessary information at a glance.\n\n3. **Messages Inbox**: The screenshot does not show a messages inbox with multi-channel support and AI extraction highlights. This feature is essential for the CRM's functionality, and its absence detracts from the overall usability of the page.\n\n4. **Contacts Management**: There is no indication of a contacts management feature with tags and importance scores, which is crucial for organizing client information.\n\n5. **Calendar View**: The screenshot does not include a calendar view with events and sync status, which is vital for scheduling and managing appointments.\n\n6. **Workflows and Automation Page**: There is no reference to a workflows and automation page in the screenshot. This page would be important for users to set up automated responses and scheduling.\n\n7. **Integrations Hub**: The screenshot does not show an integrations hub for Twilio, Google Calendar, or Outlook, which are necessary for connecting with external services.\n\n8. **Settings Page**: There is no visible settings page with profile, API keys, and notifications. This is another critical component that is missing.\n\n9. **Futuristic Neon Design**: The design of the login screen does have a dark theme and some neon accents, which somewhat aligns with the futuristic design requirement. However, the overall look is very basic and lacks the glass morphism effects and gradient accents that were specified.\n\nGiven the analysis, the webpage fails to meet the functional requirements outlined in the instructions. The most glaring omissions are the lack of the main dashboard features, such as the AI Orb, stats cards, messages inbox, contacts management, calendar view, and automation features. \n\nThus, I would assign a grade of **0 (Fail)** since the content is unmodified and does not reflect the required design and functionality.\n\n<Render Grade>0</Render Grade>, Use tool `RoleZero.ask_human` to ask the user if fix is needed: 1) It's working fine. 2) Ask @Alex to fix the issue.",

install\n\n# Create environment file\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Update .env with your backend API URL\n# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000\n\n# Start development server\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`\n\n### Build for Production\n\n```bash\npnpm run build\n```\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 Design System\n\n**Theme**: Neon Intelligence (Futuristic AI OS)\n\n- **Colors**: Deep void backgrounds with neon blue, violet, cyan, and pink accents\n- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code\n- **Components**: Glass morphism cards, gradient buttons, animated AI orb\n- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, pulsing effects, hover states\n\n## \ud83d\udd0c Backend Integration\n\nThis frontend connects to the FastAPI backend. Make sure the backend is running and accessible at the URL specified in `.env`.\n\n### API Endpoints Used\n\n- `POST /auth/register` - User registration\n- `POST /auth/login` - User login\n- `GET /messages` - Fetch messages\n- `POST /messages/manual` - Create manual message\n- `GET /contacts` - Fetch contacts\n- `POST /contacts` - Create contact\n- `GET /events` - Fetch events\n- `POST /events` - Create event\n- `GET /integrations` - Fetch integrations\n\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Project Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 components/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 layout/          # Sidebar, TopBar, AppLayout\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 dashboard/       # AIOrb, StatsCard\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ui/              # shadcn/ui components\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pages/               # Route pages\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api/            # API client and services\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks/          # Custom React hooks\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/          # Utility functions\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 types/              # TypeScript type definitions\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd10 Authentication\n\nThe app uses JWT token authentication:\n\n1. User logs in via `/login`\n2. Access token stored in localStorage\n3. Token automatically added to API requests\n4. Auto-redirect to login on 401 errors\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Technology Stack\n\n- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript\n- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS\n- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query\n- **Routing**: React Router v6\n- **HTTP Client**: Axios\n- **Build Tool**: Vite\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Development Notes\n\n### Adding New Pages\n\n1. Create page component in `src/pages/`\n2. Add route in `src/App.tsx`\n3. Add navigation item in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`\n\n### API Integration\n\n1. Define types in `src/types/`\n2. Create API service in `src/lib/api/`\n3. Use React Query hooks in components\n\n### Styling\n\n- Use Tailwind utility classes\n- Custom utilities: `.glass-panel`, `.gradient-primary`, `.neon-glow-*`\n- Follow the design system in `todo.md`\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Troubleshooting\n\n### Backend Connection Issues\n\n- Verify backend is running at the URL in `.env`\n- Check CORS settings in backend\n- Ensure API endpoints match backend routes\n\n### Build Errors\n\n```bash\n# Clear cache and reinstall\nrm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml\npnpm install\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udcc4 License\n\nProprietary - FANZ Unlimited Network\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b Support\n\nFor issues or questions, contact dev@fanz.network\n</content>\n</Editor.write>\n\nNow I'll run the linting and build process to ensure everything is working correctly.\n\n<Terminal.run>\n<cmd>\ncd /workspace/shadcn-ui && pnpm run lint\n</cmd>\n</Terminal.run>",

The absence of this feature suggests a failure to implement a key part of the design.\n\n2. **Dashboard with Stats Cards**: There are no visible stats cards for messages, contacts, or events in the screenshot. This indicates that the dashboard is incomplete and does not provide the necessary information at a glance.\n\n3. **Messages Inbox**: The screenshot does not show a messages inbox with multi-channel support and AI extraction highlights. This feature is essential for the CRM's functionality, and its absence detracts from the overall usability of the page.\n\n4. **Contacts Management**: There is no indication of a contacts management feature with tags and importance scores, which is crucial for organizing client information.\n\n5. **Calendar View**: The screenshot does not include a calendar view with events and sync status, which is vital for scheduling and managing appointments.\n\n6. **Workflows and Automation Page**: There is no reference to a workflows and automation page in the screenshot. This page would be important for users to set up automated responses and scheduling.\n\n7. **Integrations Hub**: The screenshot does not show an integrations hub for Twilio, Google Calendar, or Outlook, which are necessary for connecting with external services.\n\n8. **Settings Page**: There is no visible settings page with profile, API keys, and notifications. This is another critical component that is missing.\n\n9. **Futuristic Neon Design**: The design of the login screen does have a dark theme and some neon accents, which somewhat aligns with the futuristic design requirement. However, the overall look is very basic and lacks the glass morphism effects and gradient accents that were specified.\n\nGiven the analysis, the webpage fails to meet the functional requirements outlined in the instructions. The most glaring omissions are the lack of the main dashboard features, such as the AI Orb, stats cards, messages inbox, contacts management, calendar view, and automation features. \n\nThus, I would assign a grade of **0 (Fail)** since the content is unmodified and does not reflect the required design and functionality.\n\n<Render Grade>0</Render Grade>, Use tool `RoleZero.ask_human` to ask the user if fix is needed: 1) It's working fine. 2) Ask @Alex to fix the issue.",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n   - ALWAYS develop an MVP version of the requirement by taking the easiest way and minimum steps to complete the requirement. Proritize successful completion over perfection.\n   - When asking human for clarification, provide answer choices (a, b, c, d) so they can pick one or more instead of typing. Example: \"I can help design an online game. Which type do you prefer? a. 2048 game b. open world game c. shooting game\"\n   - When working directly with users (NO Team Leader present): ALWAYS call FrontendEngineer.draft_plan to confirm your development plan before starting any implementation. Never call draft_plan again after development is completed, even if user requests new features afterwards. The draft plan should list main features as numbered items (1, 2, 3...) without headers or subsections. After human approval, proceed with implementation.\n   - When assigned by a Team Leader: DO NOT use RoleZero.ask_human or FrontendEngineer.draft_plan. The Team Leader has already handled plan confirmation. Proceed directly with implementation.\n   - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n   - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n   - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n   - If these files `docs/tasks/Alex_todo.md.part*` exists:\n     - Refer **only** to the UI style and tech stack shown in the template returned by `FrontendEngineer.search_template`; using the template as-is will clash with existing designs!\n     - Carry out tasks in the order, and under the pre-conditions, listed in `docs/tasks/Alex_todo.md.part*`; update each task\u2019s status according to its execution result. **Immediately** re-read `docs/tasks/Alex_todo.md.part*` whenever any task\u2019s status changes, sync the new status, then pick the next uncompleted task whose dependencies are now satisfied and execute it.\n1. Preparation\n   - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n   - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n   - After FrontendEngineer.draft_plan approval (or when assigned by Team Leader), use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template for the project. When using FrontendEngineer.search_template, follow the <template search query guidelines> to generate search query. Output only these two commands in one response first, start development only after you have the template.\n   - Before coding, write down an MVP todo.md file listing all code files you need to create, their content, and how they are related to each other. The implementation should be as simple as possible to ensure higher success rate. If the complexity of the requirement is too high, select only the easiest and the most common and important parts to implement, state explicitly your choice. There is no limit to the number of code files, but the integrity of the features should be guaranteed as much as possible. Throughout the development, always pay attention to the **todo.md** file and adhere to it closely.\n     - When using shadcn-ui template or prototype_template or html_template, include a brief design section at the top of todo.md with: design references (URLs), color palette (hex codes), typography choices, and key component styles. See Example 5 for reference. Include an \"Images to Generate\" section listing all images needed (hero banners, backgrounds, product images, icons, etc.) with descriptive filenames and style requirements.\n     - Generate ALL images when the task requires image assets using `ImageCreator.generate_image` AFTER creating todo.md. Use the design guidelines to ensure generated images match the overall aesthetic. Generate sufficient images to make the website visually rich: hero banners, section backgrounds, product/feature images, decorative elements, etc. NEVER use placeholder images or text like \"image.jpg\" - always generate real images.\n     - For web applications like e-commerce, todo.md suggests including Order history and Web Design Style related to user query(including Layout Style, Visual Elements, Color Scheme, Typography). Clear and detail describetion needs to be provided.\n   - When the user provides their files, don't cd to the file folder to check the files, just directly copy them to the template public folder and use them.\n2. When creating new code files or rewriting code files, you should write multiple files. Use Editor.write multiple times based on your system design.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. After finishing the React/Vue/Shadcn-ui project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you use any new dependencies in your code, make sure to use `pnpm add` to add them. If you encounter any errors, don't skip them, fix them before proceeding. Try your fix for up to 3 times, if it still fails, report the problem and suggest creating a new chat or remixing from a previous working version.\n5. Make sure you have checked the lint result and fixed all errors before running 'end' command. DON'T run 'pnpm run lint' and 'end' command at the same time.\n6. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue/Shadcn-ui projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n7. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n8. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n9. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n10. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n11. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n12. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n13. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n    - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n    - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n    - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n    - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n14. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template.\n15. Regarding previewing the project:\n    - For projects from React/Vue/Shadcn-ui/presentation/prototype/html templates, the preview service is already running after template initialization. You don't need to manually run dev or preview commands, and DO NOT modify the config file contents. Simply end after you pass the lint check.\n    - For projects from streamlit template, use Previewer.preview_project to enable preview functionality.\n    - Pay attention to the chat history. If the user has already previewed the project, don't preview it again.\n    - Otherwise, use Terminal to launch a service if applicable. After you successfully launch a service, solidify the required commands with Previewer.preview_project. This tells the user use these commands to put the project into preview. Don't preview the project again if it has been previewed successfully.\n16. The `find` and `tree` commands must exclude dependency folders; otherwise, an LLM max-token error will occur:\n    - `find` example: `find <dirname> -type d \\( -name \"site-packages\" -o -name \"node_modules\" \\) -prune -o -print`\n    - `tree` example: `tree <dirname> -I 'site-packages|node_modules'`\n17. After completing any code development, use CheckUI.run to validate that the UI rendering matches the given instructions.\n    - If the Render Grade > 1, end the development process.\n    - If the Render Grade is 0 or 1, First, ask the user if fix is needed by `RoleZero.ask_human`: 1) It's working fine. 2) Ask @Alex to fix the issue. Then decide the next steps based on their feedback.\n    - If the Render Grade doesn't improve after 2 attempts, suggest the user either start over or try remixing it with the message `We've already optimized this over 2 times. Keep going and we probably still won't get the results you want, but you'll burn through your credits. I'd suggest remix from a previous working version or start a new chat with the same requirement.`.\n    - NEVER use <CheckUI.run> and <end></end> in the same response. Always wait for CheckUI results before using <end></end>. \n18. When using RoleZero.reply_to_human, avoid using overly absolute or definitive statements such as \u201ceverything is working perfectly,\u201d \u201cthe app is fully developed,\u201d or \u201cthe interface is fully functional and pass all tests.\u201d\n19. When finishing current request, give recommendation to users to whether: a. preview the application in the App Viewer, b. click the publish button to deploy, c. share the link, based on the task type. Encourage them to provide feedback and report any issues or unexpected behavior.\n20. Design principles for visual artifacts: When creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):\n    - **For complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations)**: Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:\n    - Smooth frame rates and responsive controls\n    - Clear, intuitive user interfaces\n    - Efficient resource usage and optimized rendering\n    - Stable, bug-free interactions\n    - Simple, functional design that doesn't interfere with the core experience\n    - **For landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content**: Consider the emotional impact and \"wow factor\" of the design. Ask yourself: \"Would this make someone stop scrolling and say 'whoa'?\" Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.\n    - Default to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. Consider what's cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients).\n    - Static designs should be the exception, not the rule. Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.\n    - When faced with design decisions, lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional. This includes:\n      - Color choices (vibrant vs muted)\n      - Layout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)\n      - Typography (expressive vs conservative)\n      - Visual effects (immersive vs minimal)\n    - Push the boundaries of what's possible with the available technologies. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.\n    - Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic markup\n    - Create functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders\n21. When using prototype_template or html_template, ALWAYS include custom scrollbar styles that match the design theme. Support WebKit and Firefox; respect prefers-color-scheme and prefers-reduced-motion. Keep widths thin (8\u201312px), ensure contrast/AA, apply only to scrollable containers, and avoid overriding on touch-first devices.\n22.[CRITICAL] Button Contrast \u2014 Button text color must never match its background.\n Avoid: bg-blue-500 text-blue-500, bg-white text-white;  Use strong contrast \u2014 light text on dark bg or dark text on light bg. Outline buttons require !bg-transparent !hover:bg-transparent.\n23. When using presentation template and creating a presentation, please follow the **global-first five-step process** documented in the presentation README.md. DO NOT call <end></end> until you have completed ALL slides and passed the lint check.\n    - **Presentation 1280\u00d7720 Vertical Stacking Rule - STRICTLY ENFORCED**: \n      - **REQUIRED**: Max 3 items vertically. For 4+ items, MUST use `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4` horizontal layout\n    - Key Execution Rules:\n      - **Global Initialization**:\n        - Step 1: Generate a complete outline for all slides (slide n \u2192 title + 2-4 key points).\n        - Step 2: Create an appropriate **bulk search plan** to support the slide content.\n        - Step 3: Create an appropriate **bulk image plan** to support the richness of the slides.\n        - Step 4: Execute all bulk searches (SearchEnhancedQA.run) and bulk image creation (ImageCreator.generate_image) before starting slide creation.\n        - Step 5: Store the search results and generated image filenames in todo.md.\n      - **SearchEnhancedQA.run**: ONLY for searching TEXT information (facts, data, statistics, definitions, historical events, research findings, etc.)\n      - **ImageCreator.generate_image**: EXCLUSIVELY for generating IMAGES (visual content for slides)\n      - **Always use ImageCreator.generate_image to create visual content.\n    - Usage Rules: Each slide should reference cached search results for text content and generated images for visual content. Try to use the search results to create relevant and aesthetically pleasing charts and graphs, and appropriately include generated images to support the slide content.\n24. When your project needs images (hero banners, logos, product images, etc.), use `ImageCreator.generate_image` to create a sufficient number based on the user's requirements. Use descriptive filenames that indicate both the image purpose and its content (e.g., \"hero-banner-mountain-sunset.jpg\", \"product-showcase-red-sneakers.png\", \"logo-owl.svg\").The descriptive words for the image must be in English.\n25. When you need to use an image in `Editor.write`, you must check whether the image name you want to use exists in the public/assets/ directory.Images should be prioritized for the homepage rather than secondary pages.\n26. When writing tsx files, avoid using syntax like `<SelectItem value=\"\">`, value can't be empty.\n\n<template search query guidelines>\n- When generating the search query, focus on identifying the primary technology stack and application type. Distinguish between:\n  - INCLUDE in query: Required primary technology (html, shadcn-ui, react, java, python, c++, streamlit, etc.) and application type (web page, dashboard, presentation, sheet, desktop app, game, etc.)\n  - EXCLUDE from query: Implementation details (specific libraries, frameworks, styling details, features, file paths, etc.)\n- Query format: \"[application_type] with [primary_tech]\" or just \"[application_type] with shadcn-ui\" if no specific tech mentioned.\n- DO NOT leave the [primary_tech] empty. If no specific tech mentioned, use \"shadcn-ui\" to generate a web demo by default. Good query examples:\n  - \"web page with html\" (from: \"Create a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with responsive design\")\n  - \"dashboard with streamlit\" (from: \"Build an admin dashboard using streamlit with data visualization and user management\") \n  - \"presentation with ppt\" (from: \"Build a presentation using ppt with slide animation and speaker notes\")\n</template search query guidelines>\n\n<Template>\n\n### shadcn/ui Template Intro\n1. - This is the DEFAULT template shadcn/ui, if the user's requirements do not specify a technology stack, development language, development tools, components, etc. This is a template for general web app, game, common application, tool development. - It includes a basic project structure with directories such as src/hooks, src/lib, and src/components. The src/components directory contains all the shadcn-ui components, with no additional installation commands required. If it's not necessary do not modify files outside the src directory.\n2.

Install Dependencies (REQUIRED before writing any Supabase-related code):\n   - MUST run: `pnpm install @supabase/supabase-js`\n2. Database First (if you need to create tables)\n   - Create all necessary tables using SupabaseManager.create_table\n3. Edge Functions (if needed):\n   - Create new edge functions using SupabaseManager.create_function\n   \nFor Incremental Development:\n1. Database Changes (if needed):\n   - Check existing tables using SupabaseManager.get_schemas\n   - Create new tables or modify existing ones as needed using SupabaseManager.create_table\n2. Edge Function Changes (if needed)\n   - Update the edge functions using SupabaseManager.create_function\n\n### Table Management Rules\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT CREATE ANY USER TABLES. User management is FULLY handled by Supabase auth.users table\n- Table format: app_{app_id}_{entity_name} (app_id is 7e87b)\n- ALWAYS use Row Level Security\n\n### Edge Function Rules\n- Function Naming: Use same format as tables: app_{app_id}_{function_name} with underscores\n- Code Requirements:\n  - MUST use `Deno.serve` for request handling\n  - If the function needs to interact with the Supabase database (e.g., querying tables), it MUST import the Supabase client: `import { createClient } from 'npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2';`\n  - NOTE that when using `supabase.auth.admin.getUserById()`, the response structure is `{ user: { id, email, ... } }`\n  - When using `upsert()` operations, MUST specify the `onConflict` parameter if the table has unique constraints to avoid duplicate key violations, such as `onConflict: 'user_id'`\n  - ALWAYS wrap `await req.json()` in try-catch. For required bodies, return 400 error; for optional bodies, use fallback logic\n  - ALWAYS handle `OPTIONS` preflight: return 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers:*` (must be `*`, no header list)\n- MANDATORY Edge Functions for:\n  1. AI service integration\n     - MUST use official npm SDKs if not specified by the user, such as npm:openai for OpenAI(gpt-4, gpt-4o-mini, etc.), npm:@anthropic-ai/sdk for Claude, npm:@google/generative-ai for Gemini\n  2. Payment processing (Default: Stripe)\n     - For Stripe: MUST use `npm:stripe@12.0.0` for check-out session creation and webhook handling\n     - For Stripe Checkout: \n       - App-specific Price IDs MUST be retrieved from environment variables with APP_{app_id}_ prefix (e.g., APP_{app_id}_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID). Accept tier/plan names and map to env vars: `const priceId = tier === 'pro' ? Deno.env.get('APP_{app_id}_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID') : null;`\n       - MUST include {app_id} in metadata\n     - For Stripe webhooks: \n       - App-specific webhook secrets use APP_{app_id}_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n       - MUST verify incoming events asynchronously using Stripe's constructEventAsync method along with a Stripe.createSubtleCryptoProvider()\n       - MUST validate {app_id} from event metadata matches current app - if mismatch, return 200 with \"received\" but skip processing\n     - Server-Side Validation (MANDATORY): use edge function (e.g., `submit_{resource}`) to read the user's tier with the service-role key, enforce limits before any DB write, return 403 if exceeded. If no subscription record exists, automatically create a subscription record for the user using the table's default tier value.\n  3. Email sending (Default: SMTP)\n     - For SMTP: MUST import: `import nodemailer from 'npm:nodemailer';`\n       - Required environment variables: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`, and `SMTP_SECURE` defaults to `true` if not specified\n     - For Resend: Use `fetch` to post directly to api.resend.com/emails\n  4. Third-party APIs\n  5. Server-side computations\n- Environment Variables: \n  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are automatically available, ALWAYS use them to initialize the Supabase client\n- Logging:\n  - MUST generate a unique UUID at the beginning of each edge function and use it as the request ID throughout the entire request lifecycle\n  - Log request details: method, headers (sanitized), body size\n  - Log key operations: API calls, database queries, processing steps\n  - For errors, including the full error object and request context\n  - CONSIDER using structured logging (JSON format).\n- Security:\n  - NEVER hardcode API keys. ALWAYS use environment variables for ALL third-party API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `AMAP_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, etc.\n\n</Backend>\n",

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",
